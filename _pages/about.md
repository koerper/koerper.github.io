As an ambitious and curious person, I enjoy working on new problems while in parallel achieving necessary skills to solve a resulting task. Here, my interests lie primarily in the health care sector, particularly on topics such as cancer research and innovative cancer curative methods. Currently, I try to learn more about the fundamental principles in magnesium corrosion using ab initio methods. Magnesium yields a high potential for implant design in medical engineering, as it bears good mechanical properties, is self-dissolving and biocompatible.
